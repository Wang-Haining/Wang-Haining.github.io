<p>Hi üëã I'm a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science at the Indiana University School of Medicine. I do NLP with real-world data. I study cultural and sociotechnical dynamics and use those insights to build better AI for everyone ü§ó. I'm actively seeking tenure-track assistant professor positions starting in 2026.</p>
<p>My representative work includes:</p>
<!-- * üíä Phenotyping with [effective and secure use of medication records](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1l9XvvgIIPtDGAPmZ9hQDdLs4AVYYyLYh2GQtTsA--rQ/edit?usp=sharing) through simple chat with LLMs, -->

</li>
<li>
<p>Our DualReasoning approach shows great promise in incorporating long-text medication information for diabetes phenotyping, outperforming alternative methods.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>(Dec 27, 2024) Our <em>DSH</em> paper on solving authorship disputes between Lu Xun and Zhou Zuoren's early works is out‚Äî<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqae084">give it a read!</a></p>
